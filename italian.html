            Santora “Fred” Iozzo, born in Italy in 1888 and immigrated to the US at 17, established 
            a chain of grocery stores in Indianapolis by 1926, which closed due to the Great 
            Depression. He then opened Naples Grill in 1930, Indianapolis' first full-service Italian 
            restaurant. Renamed <i>Iozzo's Garden of Italy</i> it thrived until an incident in 1940 led to 
            its closure. The Iozzo family legacy continued, and in 2009 the restaurant reopened, 
            blending traditional recipes with new ones, earning accolades like “Best Italian Restaurant 
            in Indianapolis” and features in “Indianapolis Monthly” magazine, committing to high-quality 
            Italian dining.
