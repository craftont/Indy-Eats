        <div class="description">While the first <i>P.F. Chang's</i> opened in 1993, our story began 
            in the early 1960s when our co-founder, Philip Chiang, stepped in to help run the family 
            restaurant. He later channeled his budding culinary talents into creating modern 
            adaptations of his family's traditional Chinese dishes, opening his own restaurant, 
            Mandarette. He never set out to build a global brand, but then he met the man who 
            would become the P.F. in our name: Paul Fleming. Paul, a successful restaurateur and a 
            regular guest at Mandarette, was so impressed with the simple, purposeful recipes being 
            served up that he wanted to share them with the masses. With a handshake, P.F. Chang's 
            was born.
